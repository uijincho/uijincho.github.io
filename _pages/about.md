Hi, I'm an undergraduate student at Brown University studying applied mathematics, computer science, and education.

I'm interested in exploring ...
- how [real world data](https://github.com/uijincho/seoul-monsoon) shapes **sustainability efforts** globally,
- its influence on **economic decision-making**, as well as 
- **expanding STEM access** through [education](https://github.com/uijincho/vex-pros) and [hackathons](https://bionicbruins.org/blus-hacks-2025/).

**Currently**, I working on getting my paper on [air quality & monsoon trends](https://github.com/uijincho/seoul-monsoon) in Seoul, South Korea published with Dr. Piccione  

I also compete with Brown University Badminton, enjoy [reading](https://goodreads.org/uijincho) in my free time, and play [oboe & english horn](/music) in musical productions.

**Contact me** at `uijin [_] cho [at] brown [dot] edu`
